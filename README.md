# Sample Nginx Conf Files for Laravel, WordPress, and Both

In the repo, I include 3 nginx_sites conf files that work with DevKinsta.

1. my-laravel-app.conf handles a site with only Laravel.
2. my-wp-app.conf handles a site with only WordPress.
3. my-wp-laravel-app.conf handles a site with both WordPress and Laravel.
